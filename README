###ALPHA

In this folder, you will find my HUD, my mods, and anything else I feel like posting.

###BRAVO

Folder name syntax:
[cfg]: Constant, or until name change.
[YYYY-MM-DD]: All dates are written in ISO 8601. For more, visit: https://i.imgur.com/7YXXJGv.png

###CHARMANDER

*Explanation of WHAT IS IN THIS FOLDER:*
You will find the latest version of my scripts, mods, customizations, and other small tweaks and changes. These can, of course, be dragged straight into the /tf/ folder. Once the folders are dragged in, just rename them and remove the date from the name.

Folders:

Folder name syntax is explained above.
* cfg-YYYY-MM-DD: The config folder as of that day.
* custom-YYYY-MM-DD: The custom folder as of that day.
* custom-YYYY-MM-DD/DISABLED: Disabled vpk's and mods. The sound folder located there shouldn't have anything in it but a .cache.
* Tweaks: Any little tweaks anybody ask of me, or I myself need, I try to put in here. Any requests will be fulfilled.

VPK's:

* nosoundscapes: Disables ambient sounds on maps, basically taking the dubstep or bird noises off those kinds of maps.

tip_itemfx: Nifty little mod that will attempt to revamp the particles, optimizing and preventing some lag spikes that
EVERYONE faces.

PREC: A little plugin that automatically records demos, does not break often. Please use regardless of whether you
actually want to or not.

OF ALL VPKS ABOVE, YOU ONLY NEED TO INSTALL THE ONES YOU LIKE/NEED. THEY ARE FOR FPS PURPOSES, BUT ARE STILL WIDELY 
USED.

Logitech G700s

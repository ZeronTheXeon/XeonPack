..........CHARMANDER..........

Explanation of WHAT IS IN THIS FOLDER:
You will find the latest version of my scripts, mods, customizations, and other small tweaks and changes. These can, of course, be dragged straight into the /tf/ folder. Once the folders are dragged in, just rename them and remove the date from the name.

Folders:

Folder name syntax is explained above, from now on, I will be bundling mods/plugins within their respective folders, as well as
explaining how to customize each if requested.

Customizations: Any little tweaks anybody ask of me, or I myself need, I try to put in here. Any requests will be fulfilled.

VPK's:

LoD Project: Highly recommended, creates LoD meshes to reduce lag on distance. Only about 8% done and its been 2 years.

nohatsmod: Basically in the name, disables hats on all players except for some new ones. Gets updated often.
Blasphemous, I know.

nosoundscapes: Disables ambient sounds on maps, basically taking the dubstep or bird noises off those kinds of maps.

tip_itemfx: Nifty little mod that will attempt to revamp the particles, optimizing and preventing some lag spikes that
EVERYONE faces.

PREC: A little plugin that automatically records demos, does not break often. Please use regardless of whether you
actually want to or not.

OF ALL VPKS ABOVE, YOU ONLY NEED TO INSTALL THE ONES YOU LIKE/NEED. THEY ARE FOR FPS PURPOSES, BUT ARE STILL WIDELY 
USED.

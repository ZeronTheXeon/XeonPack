// |----------------(by TheXeon)----------------|
// |--------------------------------------------|
 
// | TheXeon's Demo Tool is a quick script that is based off most of the code of Mr. Epping's Spy Tool.
// | It focuses on ease of use and augmenting of spy functions, making it easier to play demo.
// | This includes sticky jumping and more to come.
// | You are free to take this script and modify it to your heart's content, as long as you mention Mr. Epping and my name.

// | Usage:


exec defaultbinds

bind "SHIFT" "+demo_special"

alias "+demo_special" "+demo_m1_spec"
alias "-demo_special" "-demo_m1_spec"


alias "+demo_m1_spec" "bind MOUSE1 +pj"
alias "-demo_m1_spec" "bind MOUSE1 +attack"

alias +pj "+lj; +attack2"
alias -pj "-lj"
alias +lj "+duck;wait;wait;+jump"
alias -lj "-duck;-jump; -attack2"
